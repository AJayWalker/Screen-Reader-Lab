        <tr>
            <td>Control</td>
            <td>Pressing the 'Control' key will stop the voice over from reading</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tab</td>
            <td>Selects next link/button on page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Control + Option + Space</td>
            <td>activates a selected link</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Option + Control + A</td>
            <td>Reads continuously</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Option + Control + Right Arrow</td>
            <td>Skips to the next item on the page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Command + Control + Option + H</td>
            <td>Skips to next header and reads it aloud</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>A website that works well with the screen reader is <a href="https://www.bbc.com">BBC's home page</a>. 
        BBC's page can be traversed with the "Control + Option + H" command which will 
        read the titles of each article that the page currently has on its featured list.

        An example of a website that does not work well would be <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/">Barnes and Noble's website</a>.
        The page has too many tabs and as a visitor you are often greeted with a cookies popup which can be difficult for visually impared users
        to accept or deal with in the case where they do not wish to accept. The multitude of tabs also makes it difficult to navigate because
        of how cluttered it feels to try and skip through the unnecessary tabs. Switching between using "Command + Control + Option + H" and 
        "Option + Control + Right Arrow" also feels cluttered and difficult to find what is being looked for.
